Inspired by [Daniel Takeshi][1].

This repo contains notes for the papers that are apart of the course [16-881 Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotics][2]. Papers here are arranged by theme, and for the most part will have 2 papers associated with it: One on a deep reinforcement learning approach, the other on a different approach that may or may not use reinforcement learning. For reference, these notes assume the reader has a basic grasp of RL approaches, more specificallly, policy gradients, as action spaces in robotics are general non-discrete. My goal through reading these papers is to gain insight into reinforcement learning applications to robotics and hopefully inspire me to do research in the future.
