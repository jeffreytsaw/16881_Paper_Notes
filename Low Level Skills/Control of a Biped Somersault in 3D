# Control of a Biped Somersault in 3D

3 ways of performing reorientations in flight with no angular momentum changes: Changing moment of inertia to influlence rotation rate (i.e figure skater spins), momentum free rotations through folding and unfollding, reorient principle axis of inertia to the fixed angulalr momentum vector (used often to induce twists in somersaults)

Reroienting body relative to angular momentum vector helps initiate twists. Reorientations instigated through asymmetric motions of arms or legs.

Timing of movements more crucial thaan speed at which reorientaations occur.

Mechanics of the somersault relates time of flight and time to rotate through desired change in body orientation. More specifically, it finds the ratio of required change in pitch to successfully land somersaualt to pitch change rate at lift off by relating height and vertical velocity of com at lift-off, and desired height of com at touchdown.

One strategy is to precisely control initial conditions (pitch rotation rate, vertical velocity and position of com) to satisfy the somersault mechanics equation. This would create a somersault to desired pitch rotation. Problem is changes to these initial conditions would drastically affect performance
